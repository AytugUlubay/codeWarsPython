"""A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length.

The сoordinates of a point in the grid are written as (x,y). Each point in a coordinate system has eight neighboring points. Provided that the grid step = 1.

It is necessary to write a function that takes a coordinate on the x-axis and y-axis and returns a list of all the neighboring points. Points inside your returned list need not be sorted (any order is valid).

For Example:

cartesian_neighbor(2,2) -> [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)]
cartesian_neighbor(5,7) -> [(6,7),(6,6),(6,8),(4,7),(4,6),(4,8),(5,6),(5,8)]"""
def cartesian_neighbor(x,y):
    k=[]
    for i in range(x-1,x+2):
        for j in range(y-1,y+2):
            k.append((i,j))
    k.remove((x,y))
    return k
