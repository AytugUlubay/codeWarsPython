"""Description
You are Saitama (a.k.a One Punch Man), and you are fighting against the monsters! You are strong enough to kill them with one punch, but after you punch 3 times, one of the remaining monsters will hit you once.

Your health is health; number of monsters is monsters, damage that monster can give you is damage.

Task
Write a function that will calculate:

how many hits you received, how much damage you received and your remaining health.

if your health is <= 0, you die and function should return "hero died".

Examples
(100, 3, 33)  => "hits: 0, damage: 0, health: 100"
( 50, 7, 10)  => "hits: 2, damage: 20, health: 30"
Note
All numbers are strictly positive. Your function should always return a string."""
def kill_monsters(health, monsters, damage):
    hit=0
    while monsters>3:
        monsters-=3
        hit+=1
    dmg=damage*hit
    hlt=health-dmg
    if hlt<=0:
        return("hero died")
    return "hits: {}, damage: {}, health: {}".format(hit,dmg,hlt)
